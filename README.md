The Ballad of the Bouncing Orb

Within this digital expanse, a lone orb takes its flight,
A point of light, a nascent star, against the endless night.
It starts its journey, soft and slow, a whisper in the void,
Then meets the world's unseen embrace, its destiny deployed.

With every touch, a vibrant thread, a memory takes its form,
Connecting impact's fleeting kiss, weathering every storm.
These lines, they weave a tapestry, a geometric art,
A growing web of choices made, a beating, visual heart.

The Force of Gravity, a constant, gentle hand,
Guides down the orb, across the digital sand.
Yet speed it gains with every bounce, a quickening desire,
Fueled by the boundary's firm reply, setting its soul afire.

And when its spirit burns too bright, its velocity too keen,
It shatters the confining round, a world unseen, serene.
Outside it soars, a golden gleam, on freedom's heady air,
But tethers of its past still pull, a gentle, binding snare.

Each line, a string, now hums with tension, yearning for return,
While cosmic drag its fervor saps, a lesson it must learn.
Pulled back it comes, by gravity and memories it has spun,
To dance again within the bounds, its outer journey done.

A Symphony of Sound accompanies its play,
From gentle blips to cosmic whoosh, lighting its vibrant way.
You, the observer, hold the reins, the maestro of this scene,
Adjust the forces, choose the tunes, what will your canvas mean?

So watch it dance, this point of light, its story to unfold,
A ballet of physics and of chance, more precious than pure gold.
